    <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>

    <p>Many consumers have had poor experiences with commercial airlines,
        especially after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted travel possibilities 
        for consumers around the world. There are a number of factors that contribute 
        to negative travel experiences, including poor service, delayed flights, uncomfortable 
        in-flight seating, lost luggage, and long wait times. With so many airline options available
         to the public, it is important for consumers to understand their options, and which airlines will
        (and won’t) satisfy their travel needs. By conducting a thorough analysis of our dataset of
        airline reviews, we can gain valuable insights into consumer airline experiences that have the 
        potential to disrupt the entire global airline industry worth $726.8 billion. Not only does this
         data exploration have significant financial implications, but it can also serve as a starting point
         for addressing core issues within the travel industry. It can improve airline services, streamline business
         operations, and perhaps most importantly, boost customer satisfaction in years to come. After cleaning 
         the dataset, performing detailed sentiment analysis, and creating interactive visualizations, this analysis
         aims to identify why airline reviews receive the rating that they get. This helps the industry through
        pinpointing areas of improvement, as well as assisting the consumer by breaking down the context of reviews.

    <h2>The Dataset</h2>

    <p> The dataset we used for this project is named <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushipitroda/airline-reviews">
        “SkyRatings: Unleashing 23K+ Airline Reviews!”</a>, which can be found on Kaggle. The reviews were scraped from
        <a href="www.airlinequality.com">www.airlinequality.com</a>, which is an open forum where passengers
        can share their flight experiences to help other passengers make informed booking decisions. The original data
        contained 23,172 reviews. Depending on the visualization, the dataset was cleaned and filtered to best fit the
        attributes being analyzed. The attributes are as follows: </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b><code>Airline Name</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Overall Rating</code></b>
        <ul><li>The rating of the reviewer's experience with the airline between 1 and 9</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><b><code>Review Title</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Review Date</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Verified</code></b>
        <ul><li>Boolean value indicating in the reviewer is a verified user</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><b><code>Review</code></b>
        <ul><li>Full string of the written review for the airline</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><b><code>Aircraft</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Type Of Traveller</code></b></li>
        <ul><li>One of four types of travellers:<ul>
            <li>Business</li>
            <li>Couple Leisure</li>
            <li>Family Leisure</li>
            <li>Solo Leisure</li>
        </ul></li></ul>
        <li><b><code>Seat Type</code></b>
        <ul><li>Economy, Business, First Class, etc.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><b><code>Route</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Date Flown</code></b>
        <ul><li>Month and year that trip was taken</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><b><code>Recommended</code></b>
        <ul><li>Boolean value representing if the reviewer would recommend this airline to others</li></ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The remaining attributes are "subscores" of the overall rating, meaning that the reviewer also rated the
        quality of more specific parts of their flight. Unlike with <code>Overall Rating</code>, all of these ratings
        are between 1 and 5. The categories are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b><code>Seat Comfort</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Cabin Staff Service</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Food & Beverages</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Ground Service</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Inflight Entertainment</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Wifi & Connectivity</code></b></li>
        <li><b><code>Value For Money</code></b></li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Subscore Visualizations</h2>

    <h3>Composition of Overall Ratings</h3>

        <div class = 'center'>
                <iframe src="area-new.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>
                </p>
            </div>
    <p>
        The area plot displayed above showcases the distribution of <b><code>Overall Rating</code></b> values.
                    Additionally, the data is color-coded by rating sentiment, which can be "Positive" (ratings of 7 to 9),
                    "Neutral" (ratings of 4 to 6), or "Negative" (ratings of 1 to 3). The plot's tooltip gives more specific
                    information on each individual ratings frequency. One evident fact that it helps to highlight is that
                    "1" ratings are the most common by far. There are ~11,000 of them, while almost every other bucket has
                    less than 2,000. In other words, a majority of the reviews are extremely harsh,
                    which makes sense since customers are more likely to leave a review if they were wronged
                    by the airline, and want to warn others before booking. "Neutral" reviews have the fewest ratings,
                    which is logical because if customers don't care as much about an airline, they’re
                    less inclined to provide their opinion on it. "Positive" reviews are slightly more frequent than
                    "Neutral" ones, which is intriguing because you would believe that if people were passionate about a
                    trip, you would see similar frequencies to the negative reviews. This is likely because people only
                    really care about the quality of their flight when things go horribly wrong. Therefore, from the airline's
                    perspective, it's critical that issues with the services are addressed first before looking to improve
                    aspects that are already good. Also, because of this skew, potential traveller's should view these ratings
                    as evaluation of how little issues they had with their trip.
    </p>
    <h3>Importance of Subscores based on Traveller Classification</h3>

        <div class = 'center'>
                <iframe src="rating.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> This bar plot compares each kind of traveller's ratings towards each different subscore. If airlines
                    were looking to appeal to a given market segment, this visualization would help to identify where each
                    traveller type's values lie. By layering the types of travellers side-by-side in this fashion, two
                    distinct groupings can be seen. "Business" and "Solo Leisure" share very similar ratings, as well as
                    "Couple Leisure" and "Family Leisure". Coincidentally, both of these groups can be boiled down to solo
                    travellers and group travellers. With this correlation in mind, it shows that solo travellers have higher ratings
                    across the board compared to than group travellers, implying that they are less critical towards their flight experience.
                    This is supported by the point identified in the previous graph that overall ratings are mostly influenced
                    by those hard-hitting negative reviews. Even with these individual differences, it's clear that all of
                    these groups are following a similar trend to which aspects of the flight they care about the most.
                    This graph points out that passengers have the worst experiences with airline wi-fi relative to everything
                    else. Most people turn to their phones and computers when they are
                    on a plane, so if they are having connectivity issues the entire time, they are likely going to be very
                    annoyed and leave bad reviews.

        <h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>

        <p>
           Sentiment analysis was conducted on airline reviews to better understand customer satisfaction.
            The analysis utilized sentiment scores, including positive, negative, and composite compound scores to conduct
            a comprehensive assessment of each review. The data revealed significant variations in sentiment across airlines,
            with some showing consistently positive feedback, while others exhibiting more polarized responses. Airlines
            with high sentiment volatility often can possibly be correlated with specific events or operational inconsistencies.
            Below are two interactive visualization of the data collected from this analysis:
        </p>

        <h3>Sentiment Trends over Time</h3>
        
        <div class = 'center'>
                <iframe src="sentiment.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> This plot displayed the compound sentiment scores for various airlines over time. The filter displays
                    one airline at a time, and any airline in the dataset can be selected to display their trend. By highlighting
                    changes in sentiment, the line chart can enable stakeholders to identify specific periods of
                    heightened customer dissatisfaction or approval. For instance, a sudden drop in sentiment could
                    signal operational issues, such as flight delays or cancellations, while a peak might indicate
                    successful promotional campaigns or exceptional service experiences. It was expected that the trends
                    shown by these views would be linear and flat, however, many of the major airlines have trends that
                    shoot erratically up and down on sentiment. There are a couple of likely reasons for this. First off,
                    given the size of the dataset (~23,000 reviews) compared to the number of airlines present (~500), if
                    the reviews were hypothetically spread evenly, there would only be about 46 reviews per airline. That
                    number of datapoints is not sufficient to show a smooth curve across timelines that sometimes span over
                    a decade. However, since these graph are showcasing individual reviews, it goes to show that flight
                    experience overall is very volatile in general. Some people have a normal flight with no issues, while
                    other people can fly the same airline and have terrible things happen to them. Therefore, it's important
                    to recognize the pitfalls in generalizing the quality of an airline.
                </p>
            </div>

        <h3>Word Cloud</h3>

        <div class = 'center'>
                <iframe src="word_cloud.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> The Word Cloud Visualization highlights the most frequently used words in the airline reviews for both
                    positive and negative reviews. Either category can be selected with the filter at the bottom, and
                    hovering over each word gives their frequency within the entire dataset. Larger words represent terms
                    that appear more often, offering insights into common themes, concerns, or praises. On the positive side,
                    some of the larger words identify things that went will in these reviews, such as good service, comfortable
                    seating, etc. Negative reviews mention delays, cancelled flights, and extra charges. These give an idea
                    for the reasoning that each kind of review are coming in, and given the conclusions derived earlier,
                    focusing in on those negative words can help airlines improve their overall quality.
                </p>
            </div>

        <h3>Summary and Takeaways</h3>

        <p>
            This analysis shed some interesting light on how to go about booking trips. While it's tempting to look at
            one big "overall" review and pick the highest number, there is a lot more nuance to the decision. Different
            airlines excel in different areas, and it's important to select one that aligns with your values the best. The
            further down you dig into the details of each of these reviews, the more context you will find for why airlines
            are rated the way they are. The most important information will always lie within the individual reviews, since
            the progression of breaking down these reviews bit by bit put into frame just how much detail you lose when
            rounding up to one big score. When looking at this analysis on the business perspective, the takeaway is clear:
            reduce the pain on customers before improving fields that are already sufficient. The point of the transportation
            industry is to get people from point A to B with as little headache as possible, and that fact is supported
            by what was shown here. The fewer obstacles placed in front of the consumer, the better experience they'll have,
            and with that comes higher ratings which correlate with more bookings.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through the development of this project, some improvements are clear. As hinted at earlier, a larger dataset
            is vital in putting more weight behind the messages of these visualizations. Not only would more records smoothen
            out the curves, but more features in the dataset could help us come to even more useful conclusions that can help
            both the industry and the consumer. For example, rolling in ticket price can greatly impact how airline recommendations
            are made. The experience could be very good, but it might not warrant an abhorrent ticket price. Especially
            when ticket prices are easily the most considered value when it comes to booking flights, performing this
            study without that information proved difficult. However, it's very likely that that data is difficult to come across.
