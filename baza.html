    <h1> What is the driving force behind negative reviews of airlines?</h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p>Many consumers have had poor experiences with commercial airlines,
        especially after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted travel possibilities 
        for consumers around the world. There are a number of factors that contribute 
        to negative travel experiences, including poor service, delayed flights, uncomfortable 
        in-flight seating, lost luggage, and long wait times. With so many airline options available
         to the public, it is important for consumers to understand their options and which airlines will
        (and won’t) satisfy their travel needs. By conducting a thorough analysis of our dataset of negative 
        airline reviews, we can gain valuable insights into consumer airline experiences that have the 
        potential to disrupt the entire global airline industry worth $726.8 billion. Not only does this
         data exploration have significant financial implications but it can also serve as a starting point 
         for addressing core issues within the travel industry to improve airline services, streamline business 
         operations, and perhaps most importantly, boost customer satisfaction in years to come. After cleaning 
         our dataset, performing detailed sentiment analysis, and creating interactive visualizations, our group 
         aims to develop key recommendations for airlines to reshape the travel industry into one of the best-rated 
         markets in the world.

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> Our analysis makes use of two datasets. the first data is 
        a data set called `us_statewide_crime.csv` which contains 
        the following crime statistics for all US states and the 
        District of Columbia in 2010. The data has 50 rows with 9 
        features. The detail information about the features are listed
        in the following table:</p>  

        
        <p>Meanwhile, we also believe that the geographical 
            information is important when evaluating the unemployment
            rate. Therefore, we also make use of geographical information 
            on <a href="www.airlinequality.com">Natural Earth</a>. 
            The website provides the geographical information for making maps for US states. 
        </p>

        <p>KARINA, we remove the Alaska and Hawaii
            from the data. Following is an interactive map for the 
            lower 48 states in US. User can zoom in the map. The color
            indicates the unemployment rate for each state. When click any 
            state, other social factors will be revealed for the state. </p>

            </div>
            
            <p>In general, west coast states tend to have higher 
                unemployment rate. On the east coast, West virginia 
                and New York state tend to have higher unemplyment rate
                than the others. In the south, Mississippi and Louisiana
                are the ones with the much higher unemplyment rate.
            </p>

        <h3>Sentiment analysis </h3>
        
        <div class = 'center'>
                <!-- <iframe src="histogram/index.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>-->
                <iframe src="sentiment.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> First, we present an overview of the unemployment rate
                    for all 50 states. Alaska is the one with the 
                    highest unemployment rate, which may due to the seasonal 
                    business in the state. The effectiveness of labor market 
                    policies and governance structures can influence unemployment 
                    rates. Washington, D.C., being the seat of government, may 
                    experience fluctuations in employment related to government 
                    spending and policies. Mississippi and Louisiana have economies 
                    that are heavily reliant on sectors such as agriculture, 
                    manufacturing, and energy. Economic downturns or fluctuations 
                    in these industries can impact employment opportunities. 
                    Connecticut, South Dakota and Virginia have the lowest 
                    unemplyment rate. These states often have diverse economies 
                    with strong sectors such as technology, healthcare, finance, 
                    and tourism. A diverse economy can provide more resilience to 
                    economic downturns.

        <h3> The relationship between unemployment rate and other social factors</h3>

        <div class = 'container'>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p>Moreover, we also want to examine the relationship between
                    unemployment rate and other social factors in the data. All 
                    features are numerical thus we firts create a correlation
                    plot to examine whether there are linear relationship between 
                    unemployment rate with other social factors. Notice that if 
                    the correlation is small, it only means that there is no potential
                    linear relationship between two features. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on the correlation plot, among all the features, poverty 
                    has the strongest correlation with the unemployment rate since
                    they are both related to the economics. The percentage of single 
                    parents is the second important feature which inidicates the 
                    stability of family is also strongly related to the job market. 
                    The increase of unemployment rate may also related to the increase 
                    of violent crime and murder rate but has a negative relationship
                    with education indicators, like the percentage of people who go to
                    high school and college. The only variable that has no direct linear
                    relation with the unemployment rate is Metropolitan, which means the 
                    percent of residents living in a metropolitan area. 
                </p>

            </div>   
        </div>

        <p>We have also create an interactive scatter plot so that 
            our users can select a couple of states within
            a certain range of unemployment rate and to see how the 
            other factors may be related here. 
        </p>

            <iframe src="area.html" width="85%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Compare MA to the other states</h3>

        <p>
            Since we are in MA, thus we want to take a closer look between
            MA and other states. We create the following interactive plot
            such that user can choose another state to compare with MA and 
            show the bar plot on each factors. 
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="summary.html" width="95%" height="300px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the US 
            unemployment rate across states. We also examine the relation
            between unemployment rate and other social factors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, this is the 2010 data thus may be different 
            than the current economics status. Also, unemployment rate 
            may fluctuate seasonally thus adding a time series analysis
            will be more informative.
